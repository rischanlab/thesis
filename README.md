# Thesis Repository

This repository contains all the materials and projects related to my PhD thesis. The thesis is divided into three main sections, each addressing different aspects of visualization recommendation systems. Here is a breakdown of each section:

## 1. [Intro: Visualization Recommendation Systems](https://github.com/rischanlab/visualization_recommendation_systems)

   The [`visrec`](https://github.com/rischanlab/visualization_recommendation_systems) folder contains existing visualization recommendation systems whose code has been published. It serves as an introductory part, providing a foundation by exploring and understanding the currently available visualization recommendation approaches.

## 2. [Diversification in Visualization Recommendation System](https://github.com/rischanlab/DiVE)

   The [`diversity`](https://github.com/rischanlab/DiVE) folder encompasses the core of my thesis, focusing on diversification in visualization recommendation systems. It aims to tackle the diversification aspect of visualization recommendations effectively and efficiently, ensuring that users receive a varied set of visualization recommendations to choose from.

## 3. [Quality of Data Issue in Visualization Recommendation System](https://github.com/rischanlab/Data_quality_research)

   In the [`QoD`](https://github.com/rischanlab/Data_quality_research) folder, the focus shifts towards addressing data quality issues, specifically dealing with incomplete data in visualization recommendation systems. This section includes projects that observe and analyze the impact of incomplete data on the effectiveness of visualization recommendations and explore approaches to handle this challenge within the context of visualization recommendation systems.

Feel free to explore each section to delve deeper into the research and findings related to visualization recommendation systems in the scope of this thesis.
